I am <span>Béatrice GARCIA CEGARRA</span>
Engineering and IT's student<br><span>in Artificial Intelligence and Video Games</span>
&nbsp Welcome! I am Béatrice, a final year master's student at the EPF engineering school at Cachan in France. I am currently in Canada from 2023 to 2024, pursuing a double degree in <span>Computer Science</span> at the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi. <br><br>&nbsp I am particularly interested in mathematics and <span>complex problem solving</span>. In fact, I am shifting towards <span>research and artificial intelligence’s design in various fields</span> such as video games. <br><br>&nbsp If my goal is to continue my studies with a thesis in AI, I am currently looking for <span>professional experience in a technical and scientific environment</span> seeking digital solutions.

<i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i> &nbsp My projects &nbsp <i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i>
These projects had been fulfilled w,thin the scope of my studies, from december 2022 to date
SOULKNIGHT - Fantasy and Adventure's game
Video game
Blueprint, C++
Rider, UE5
October to December 2023
As part of the group project for the "Video game design and development" course, we, in a team of 5, implemented a complete medieval fantasy-inspired video game containing several puzzles, bosses and enemies. I created the <span>kinematics</span> of introduction, the <span>sounds</span> integration as well as the enemies using <span>artificial intelligence</span> technologies from Unreal Engine 5: <span>Behavior tree, blackboard, tasks, AI Perceptron, etc.</span>
Machine & Deep learning models
Artificial Intelligence
Python, Scikit-Learn
Collab, Jupyter
September to November 2023
In individual projects for the course "Fundamentals of Machine Learning", I designed, trained and analyzed several <span>machine and deep learning models</span> using the <span>Scikit-Learn library</span>: <span>Decision Tree, MLP Classifier, PMC, CNN, XG Boost, RandomForest, etc.</span>. I also had the opportunity to prepare different categorical, numerical and visual datasets and to carry out cross-validation for the learning models.
Sudokus & graphs' coloring
Artificial Intelligence
C#
Rider
January 2023
As part of a group project for the course "Artificial Intelligence I", I adapted <span>the DSatur graph coloring algorithm</span>sudokus’ solving problem. We subsequently implemented the algorithm in the working environment provided by the professor and tested its <span>performance on three difficulty levels</span> to compare its results to those of several other algorithms inspired by machine learning methods.
Physic simulation & ballistic shooter
Simulation
C++, openFrameworks
Visual Studio
September to December 2023
As part of the group project for the course "Mathematics and Physics for video games", we carried out in peer coding, in a 3D environment developed using OpenFrameworks, the simulation of collisions, forces (gravity, air friction, etc.), connecting elements (rods, cables, springs), angular and linear positions and velocities using the integration of Euler and Verlet with and without harmonics. In parallel of this work, all the mathematical elements (Matrix, Quaternion, vector) needed for the implementation of the laws on physical elements (plane, Particle, cube, sphere, etc.) have been implemented.
Secure connexions' website
Web, Security
HTML, CSS, JS, PHP
PhpStorm
November to December 2022
As part of the group project for the "Network and Web Security" course, we created a connection site offering <span>client and administrator accounts</span> with an <span>administration interface</span> span> allowing the management of password’s security parameters (validity period, expected complexity, etc.). The account management is linked to a fully encrypted php database. For my part, I made all the <span>HTML, CSS and JS user interfaces</span> as well as the <span>management and passing of password parameters</span> throughout accounts by <span>encrypted JSON files</span >.
Application of movies' management
Mobile
Kotlin
Android Studio
April to May 2023
As part of the group project for the "Mobile Hardware" course, we created a <span>movie’s management application extracted from an open source API</span> (favorite list, account creation, search by name or QR Code). I carried out the account management using a JSON file saved on the application's Internal Storage, the home, login and list view user interfaces as well as QR Code search.
